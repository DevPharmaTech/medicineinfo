## How to Run the HTML Website

1. **Locate the Files:**  
    Make sure you have downloaded or cloned the project files to your computer.

2. **Open the Main HTML File:**  
    Navigate to the project folder and find the main HTML file (usually named `index.html`).

3. **Double-Click to Open:**  
    Double-click the `index.html` file. It will open in your default web browser.

4. **Alternatively, Use a Browser:**  
    - Open your preferred web browser.
    - Use `File > Open` or drag and drop the `index.html` file into the browser window.

No additional software or server setup is required; the site runs locally in your browser.
